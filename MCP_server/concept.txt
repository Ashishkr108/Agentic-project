MCP servers expose three main primitives:

Resources
client-controlled

Exposes data to be used as context to clients on request.

Use a resource when you want to passively expose data or content to an MCP client and let the client choose when to access it.

Tools
model-controlled

Exposes executable functionality to client models.

Use a tool when you want the client to perform an action, for example to request content from an API, transform data, or send an email.

Prompts
user-controlled

Exposes reusable prompts and workflows to users.

Use a prompt when you want the client to surface prompts and workflows to the user, for example to streamline interaction with a resource or tool.
